User Story : A very simple situation is the a user (college freshman) start to attend his/her college. He wonders where he can find the most recent activitiese.g. clubbing in the bar which is closest to him. The old way is to search a specific place and it will show you details relevant to this place instead of looking for activities in a more general way.

- The most important thing when attending an event is the transportation. Usually, a gathering event makes huge impact on city's transportation. It does not allow most people to drive their own cars since it is so hard to find a parking lot in downtown. Thus, a better solution is to reserve or call a ride right before they leave for activities or after activities. The Uber or Lyft module can be embedded into the application. It allows people not only to find the navigation to the dentition but also reserve a ride.
