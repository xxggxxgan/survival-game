For next lab 10/25:
  -Need to show demo that pings at least one API in the backend and presents the data in the frontend somehow
  -We will be using JavaScript with node.js and React, so we should all have both those environments downloaded and ready to 
  work on
  
  Steps for next week:
    Set up environment
    Call Google News API
    Be able to specify a location and see news from Google News API for that location
        Later we will specify location by map, for now a dropdown or text box is fine
